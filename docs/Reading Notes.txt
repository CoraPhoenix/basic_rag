Types of question in the TOEFL Reading Section

1 - Vocabulary: read the sentence and mark the word or expression that best fits on ("What does it mean?")
2 - Detail: look for content words of the question (how, when, why)
3 - Inference: [more difficult] do the same as the detail question, except by jamming it (imply, suggest)

(Example:

"30% of the apples are green." What does that mean?

In a detail question -> "How many apples are green?" 30%
In an inference question -> 70% of the apples are not green
)

4 - Pronoun: (singular or plural) look at the nouns before the pronoun, and find the one which best fits in the sentence - not very common
5 - Plugin: fit the sentence in the keywords to find the content word in a sentence you have to plugin, find where it appears in the reading, and make sure to choose an answer next to that.

(Example:

given the word "apples", find the best postion for it
)

6 - Paraphrase: focus on the main, independent clause, focus on one piece at a time, and double-check the anser; if the answer mentions that piece, keep it; if not, it's not good

7 - Summary: determine if the answer summarizes the topic (first sentenceon the paragraph)

8 - Purpose: ("Why does the author mention/uses...") / ("What's the purpose of this content?") look for the sentence before the keyword of the question
